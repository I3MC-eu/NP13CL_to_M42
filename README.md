# NP13CL_to_M42
Adapting a NEX NP13CL projector lens to M42 allows it to be used with a wide variety of cameras in my case, a Sony ZV-E10.

Important Notice

Work in Progress! currently still having issues with the tollerances with the sleave therefor i have not Uploaded it yet it will follow soon.

I have not found an official source specifying the flange focal distance of the NP13CL.
The dimensions used here are based on a rough estimate that works for my copy of the lens and camera.
You may need to fine-tune the distance for your setup — this can be done easily by adding height to the 56 mm inlay.
Do not move the inlay any closer to the front element; it already sits nearly flush with the highest part of the glass, and pushing it further could cause damage.

Overview

The M42 adapter includes three 3D-printed parts:
- Sleeve covers the inner workings of the lens and provides a clean outer finish. (same for both variants)
- Flange adapter converts the original NEX-style flange to a 56 mm recessed mount.
- 56 mm disk to M42 – provides the threaded connection for the helicoid or any M42-compatible mount.
  
All parts are designed to print easily without supports.


The Sony E-mount adapter includes three 3D-printed parts:
- Sleeve covers the inner workings of the lens and provides a clean outer finish. (same for both variants)
- Flange adapter converts the original NEX-style flange to a  mm recessed mount.
- mm disk to Sony E-Mount – This is NOT my work you can find it on https://www.printables.com/model/143762-sony-efe-lens-mount made by @thenickdude (thanks!)
  
All parts are designed to print easily without supports.

Printing

Use high-detail settings for the threaded M42 section to ensure smooth engagement.
The other pieces don’t need extreme precision.
If possible, printing the threaded part in resin can improve accuracy and durability (not yet tested).

Assembly

Glue the 56 mm disk into the recessed flange and let it cure completely.
Screw the finished assembly onto the lens where the original NEX flange was located.
Slide the sleeve into place to cover the mechanism and complete the housing.
Finally, attach your M42 helicoid and adapt it to your desired camera mount.

Once complete, the NP13CL delivers a soft, cinematic, retro look a projector lens reborn for digital imaging.
