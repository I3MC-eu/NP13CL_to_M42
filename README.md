# NP13CL_to_M42
Adapting a NEX NP13CL projector lens to M42 allows it to be used with a wide variety of cameras in my case, a Sony ZV-E10.
The full setup consists of the lens, an M42 helicoid, and this three-part adapter system.

IMPORTANT! The Helicoid is a bought part not 3d printed without it you will have a very minimized focus field if you can even get it to focus.
  Just search for a M42 to M42 Helicoid. I used a 25-55mm.

Overview

The adapter includes three 3D-printed parts:
-Sleeve covers the inner workings of the lens and provides a clean outer finish.
-Flange adapter converts the original NEX-style flange to a 56 mm recessed mount.
-56 mm disk to M42 – provides the threaded connection for the helicoid or any M42-compatible mount.
All parts are designed to print easily without supports.

Printing

Use high-detail settings for the threaded M42 section to ensure smooth engagement.
The other pieces don’t need extreme precision.
If possible, printing the threaded part in resin can improve accuracy and durability (not yet tested).

Assembly

Glue the 56 mm disk into the recessed flange and let it cure completely.
Screw the finished assembly onto the lens where the original NEX flange was located.
Slide the sleeve into place to cover the mechanism and complete the housing.
Finally, attach your M42 helicoid and adapt it to your desired camera mount.

Once complete, the NP13CL delivers a soft, cinematic, retro look a projector lens reborn for digital imaging.
